Solutions mod adds several new Clentaminator solutions by way of a new town NPC, the Terraformer.
This solutions range from Filling solutions, which fill empty space with a block (or liquid), Removal solutions that remove any block (or liquid), biome spreading solutions, such as one for the Ice biome, to Ore spreading solutions that replace stone with a variety of ores and gems.
This mod also add two new Clentaminator types, also sold by the Terraformer: the "One Shot Clentaminator" that allows you to fire one solution vial at a time (no more consuming 5 vials to convert one block) and the "Boomstick Clentaminator" that fires three bursts of spray (shotgun spread) per single vial shot (also with no auto reuse). 

To unlock the Terraformer, you need to have any Clentaminator in your inventory and an empty house. If she dies, she will only respawn if you have a clentaminator with you.
